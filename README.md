# Deep3DFaceReconstruction-Pytorch
Pretrained model of Deep3DFaceReconstruction(Pytorch version)
Original tensorflow version: https://github.com/microsoft/Deep3DFaceReconstruction

0. You'd better study this project first: https://github.com/YadiraF/face3d , since the UV coordinates, the tri_mouth is derived from this project (not necessary, just a recommand, I have already put all the models needed, except the original BFM model, due to the copyright issues)

1. Download the original BFM model via this link: https://faces.dmi.unibas.ch/bfm/main.php?nav=1-2&id=downloads , 
copy 01_MorphableModel.mat to BFM/
2. Download Exp_Pca.bin from this link: https://github.com/Juyong/3DFace and save it to BFM/
3. Run process_bfm.py
